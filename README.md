# sampleproject
this is e commerce web application project created by maven.for frond end part i used bootstrap because it is responsive,provides efficiency(speed of development),prebuilt components and default java script components.for backend i used spring mvc framework.The Spring web MVC framework provides model-view-controller architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web,applications. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements. The Model encapsulates the application data and in general they will consist of POJO. The View is responsible for rendering the model data and in general it generates HTML output that the client's browser can interpret. The Controller is responsible for processing user requests and building appropriate model and passes it to the view for rendering.for middleware i used hibernate H2 database where the no of source code can be reduced.
